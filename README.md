Sales Analysis on Video Games

This project is about analyzing video game sales data using Python and several data analysis libraries. We explore the distribution of various features such as platforms, genres, publishers, and sales in different regions.

## Libraries Used
This project utilizes several Python libraries to explore and visualize the data:

`numpy`: used for mathematical operations and working with arrays

`pandas`: used for data manipulation and analysis

`matplotlib`: used for creating visualizations

`seaborn`: used for creating more advanced visualizations

## Data Cleaning
The dataset required some cleaning before we could perform our analysis. We first converted all column names to lowercase for consistency, and then we removed any missing data from the dataset. We also converted the "user_score" column from a string type to a float type to make it easier to work with.

## Data Analysis
We began our analysis by exploring the distribution of the data, focusing on the distribution of platforms, genres, publishers, and release years. We also looked at the distribution of sales across different regions, including North America, Europe, Japan, and others.

## Results
Our analysis revealed several interesting insights about the video game industry:

The most popular platform for video games in the dataset was the PlayStation 2, which accounted for over 16% of the games.

Most of the games in the dataset were released before 2011.

The most common genre for games in the dataset was "Action."

The most common publisher was Electronic Arts (EA).

North America had the highest sales of any region, followed by Europe and Japan.

## Conclusion
This project shows how Python and data analysis libraries can be used to gain insights into a large dataset. By exploring the distribution of different features in the dataset, we were able to uncover several interesting trends and patterns in the video game industry.
